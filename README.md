# scapegoat-tree

C++ implementation of Scapegoat Trees: self-balancing binary search trees that store no additional information at each node, have tunable balance specifications, and do not rely on tree rotations. The height of a Scapegoat Tree will be logarithmic in its size; insertion and deletion operations run in amortized logarithmic time and worst-case linear time.

First written for the final project in Stanford's CS166 course in Spring 2021.
